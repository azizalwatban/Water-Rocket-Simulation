# Water-Rocket-Simulation

About the Project:
Goals:
     1) Use ode45 to integrate a projectile trajectory
     2) Find the position trajectory for a three-phase water rocket
     3) Adjust parameters to achieve 80 +/- 1 m landing
    
Steps:
     1) Set constants
     2) Create a function that describes the three phases
     3) Pass it to ode45 and integrate
     4) Plot the trajectory and thrust
    
Assumptions:
     Compressible and isentropic properties of flow
     No other external forces such as wind
     Constant gravity
     2D motion
    
Units: SI
